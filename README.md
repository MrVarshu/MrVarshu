## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I am a **Computer Science (AI & ML) undergraduate** with a strong foundation in **machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and backend software engineering**.  
I specialize in building **production-style intelligent systems**, including **RAG pipelines, LLM agents, and end-to-end ML workflows**, alongside scalable backend and full-stack applications.

My interests lie at the intersection of **AI/ML and system design**, where I focus on solving real-world problems through **data-driven decision-making, robust architectures, and clean engineering practices**.  
I am actively seeking **AI/ML Engineer and Software Development Engineer (SDE)** roles.
